# 6502-Based-Microprocessor
A virtual microprocessor based off the MOS 6502 microprocessor

This (wannabe) virtual processor features:

* 16 bit memory bus
* Lots of instructions
* 6 registers (that includes the SP, PC, AR, A, X, and Y registers)
* And much more that i haven't included due to laziness

## Compiling 

See [BUILD.md](./BUILD.md) for build instructions

## TODO List

* Add more instructions
* ~~Add drag and drop functionality~~
* Turn this into a GUI
* other stupid stuff that is NOT nonsense
